# AI-Powered Behavioral Analysis for Suicide Prevention, Substance Use, and Mental Health Crisis Detection with Longitudinal Geospatial Crisis Trend Analysis 

This project focuses on extracting, processing, and analyzing crisis-related discussions from social media platforms like Twitter and Reddit. Using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the project classifies posts into risk levels based on sentiment and crisis-related language, and visualizes crisis-related trends on an interactive map.

### Objective:
The goal is to:
- Extract and preprocess social media data related to mental health distress, substance use, or suicidality.
- Apply sentiment analysis and NLP techniques to assess high-risk content.
- Geocode and visualize crisis-related trends on a basic interactive map.

## Dataset:
The dataset contains social media posts related to mental health, suicidality, and substance use. Posts are filtered based on specific keywords and cleaned for NLP analysis. The dataset includes post IDs, timestamps, content, engagement metrics (likes, comments, shares), and geolocation data.

## Example Outputs:

1. **Sentiment and Risk Distribution**: A plot showing the breakdown of posts by sentiment (Positive, Neutral, Negative) and risk level (High-Risk, Moderate Concern, Low Concern).
2. **Crisis Geolocation Heatmap**: A heatmap visualizing the geographical distribution of crisis-related discussions.
